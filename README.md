## Collaboration Reflection
This project was a valuable exercise in collaboration using Git and GitHub. Both team members contributed equally, ensuring clear communication and division of tasks. One challenge we encountered was resolving merge conflicts when changes overlapped in the index.html file. By discussing the changes and reviewing each pull request thoroughly, we successfully merged our branches without affecting the functionality of the website. The project not only enhanced our technical skills but also improved our ability to manage and coordinate development workflows in a collaborative environment
